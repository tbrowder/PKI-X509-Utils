Plan:

use native call in a module to access the various openssl subs of interest:

  x509
  rsa
  dsa
  etc.

Main exported sub is named something like:

  read-cert($cert);

which:

  reads the string or file
  determines the type: pem or der
  if der
    converts to pem
    determines type
      uses appropriate openssl func to
        write a text version
      parses the text to get information
